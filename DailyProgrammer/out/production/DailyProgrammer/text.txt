I'm a passionate software consultant and programmer of enterprise software architectures. I've spent a considerable amount of time building financial software on Wall St. and worked for companies like S&P, Goldman Sachs, AOL andJP Morgan along with helping various startups solve mission critical software problems. In my 13 years of experience, I've developed massive enterprise level software using programming languages like Java, C++, Python, PL/SQL and Ruby. I've learned many lessons along the way, and I hope to share this knowledge with aspiring software developers. I've always had a passion for teaching in seminars and corporations during my consulting projects. My online school Job Ready Programmer gives me the opportunity to share my knowledge with students of all backgrounds and experiences across the globe! I'm really excited for this opportunity to bring to you real-world practical experience! Join my initiative and we'll work together to bring out the best programmer in you!
